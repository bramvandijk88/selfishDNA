# selfishDNA
Simulated model of the co-evolution of TEs and their host genome.

The makefile has been configured to compile the entire program. The file "selfish.cpp" contains the fundamentals of the program, and uses several functions from the CASH2.1 library to run. For an interactive version of this model which requires no coding skills, see https://bramvandijk88.github.io/cacatoo/TEs_host_coevol.html
